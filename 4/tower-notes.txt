The performance ratio between plain_tower and tower was 5.14 e -5.
The reason for the large difference is due to the fact that arithmetic operators
in prolog need to be called on instantiated terms. This means that these 
arithmetic operators cannot be called on variables, meaning that the program 
must first guess the matrix/grid before applying the tower count constraint. 
This is avoided using the fd_constraint library since the library allows us to 
create constraints on the matrix elements without guessing the actual elements. 
This reduces the amount of backtracing in the program, allowing the tower 
implementation to run much much faster than the plain_tower implementation.
