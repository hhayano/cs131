For server.py

  - takes in one command line arg representing the server name
  - starts a server with predetermined ports


  - Can derive the port number from another file containing all the assigned port numbers
  - The network communication graph can also be stored in another location/file

  - Possible inputs
    - From other servers
      - location information of mobile clients
    - From clients
      - location information of themselves
      - query on other clients locations 

  - Possible messages
    - IAMAT $CLIENT_ID $CLI_COORD $TIME
    - WHATSAT $CLI_ID $RADIUS $AMT_INFO
    - CLIAT $OG_SERV $FST_SERV $SERV_TIME $CLI_ID $CLI_COORD $TIME 

  TODOS:
    NEED to change the Clients to have a server they first talked to
    The propagation between servers have to have the first server name as well
